## *Description* 

Use this app to keep track of burgers in a mySql database.  You will be able to keep track of the burger's status ( devoured or waiting to be) by the click of a button.  The burger position on the screen will change based on if it's status.  Throw the burger away when you no longer want to keep track of it.
